# Surfs_up

# Overview of Analysis

W. Avy is interested in investing in a surf shop that I want to open up. It will sell surf equipment and icecream. W. Avy wanted to compare two months of the year December and June as a previous investment he had fell through due to high levels of ran. In light of this W. Avy provided 12 months of data for us to review and show this idea will actually work.

While running this analysis, there is a potential to expand the idea to other islands, so we want to build the code in a way that can be reused if we decide to open up another shop.


# Results

The initial pull of December and June data required reframing the data intoa  consumable format:

On comparison of these two months there were a few points to note:

- There is more data collected in June than December.
- The June average weather is less than 4 degrees different than December.
- Both June and December are similar in the 50th percentile and 75th percentile, with only a few degrees difference. However, the 25th percentile starts to show larger gaps in temperature.

# Summary

The average temperature in June vs. December aren't much different. If we are looking at temperature alone, a surf shop shouldn't experience a large difference in customer volume in June or December. However, there are many other variables that should be looked at to gather more data which would show if a shop would be profitable:

- Rainfall, by days, months. This would prevent the next store from being "rained out" as W. Avy stated before.
- Storms - If December has more storms, but similar temperature many people as less likely to go to a Surf shop and stay inside.
