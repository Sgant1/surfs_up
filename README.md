# Overview of Analysis

W. Avy is interested in investing in a surf shop that I want to open up. It will sell surf equipment and icecream. W. Avy wanted to compare two months of the year December and June as a previous investment he had fell through due to high levels of ran. In light of this W. Avy provided 12 months of data for us to review and show this idea will actually work.

While running this analysis, there is a potential to expand the idea to other islands, so we want to build the code in a way that can be reused if we decide to open up another shop.
